### 4. Preliminary Development Plan
Outline a five-phase plan:
Research & Analysis – How you’ll refine user needs and study competitors.
The goal of the research phase will be to understand the fundamental requirements of clients and photographers. While clients require an easy way to browse categories, view services, and submit booking requests, photographers require a straightforward way to upload, arrange, and manage their portfolios. In order to examine common features like portfolio display, filtering options, pricing transparency, and booking workflows, existing photography portfolio and booking websites will be examined. This analysis will assist in identifying crucial features and guarantee that the website stays easy to use without needless complexity.

Design – UI/UX considerations (layout, navigation, accessibility, etc.).
To showcase photography portfolios, the website will have a simple, visual-first layout. Users will be able to view photographer profiles, browse categories, and make booking requests with ease thanks to clear navigation menus. Filtering based on categories will be made to function seamlessly without requiring a page reload. In order to provide a comfortable experience for all users, the interface will be responsive to support both desktop and mobile devices, and accessibility features like readable fonts, appropriate spacing, and clear buttons will be implemented.

Development—The website will be developed using React for the front end to create a dynamic and user-friendly interface. The back end will be built with Node.js and Express to handle server-side logic and API requests. MySQL will be used as the database to store photographer profiles, portfolio data, and booking information.

Testing—The goal of the testing phase is to make sure the website works properly and offers a seamless user experience. To evaluate usability, customers will be able to browse portfolios, filter categories, and make booking requests with ease. Performance testing will guarantee that pages load quickly, particularly portfolio pages with a lot of images. Verifying secure login capabilities, safeguarding user data, and validating form inputs to stop mistakes or abuse are all examples of basic security testing. Before launch, any problems found during testing will be fixed.

Launch & Maintenance – To make the website publicly available, a cloud-based hosting platform will be used for its deployment. The system will be observed following launch to guarantee reliable performance and proper operation. Bug fixes, content updates, and feature enhancements based on user input will all be part of routine maintenance. In order to improve usability and maintain the platform's security and dependability over time, periodic updates will also be made.
